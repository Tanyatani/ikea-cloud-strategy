## 🔍 **Business Challenge**  
✔ **Scalability Issues:** High website traffic during peak sales events causes slowdowns.  
✔ **Data Management Problems:** Fragmented inventory and customer data affect decision-making.  
✔ **Security & Compliance Risks:** Need for **GDPR compliance** and enhanced cybersecurity.  
✔ **High IT Infrastructure Costs:** On-premise servers are expensive and inefficient.  
✔ **Need for Data-Driven Decision Making:** Cloud adoption requires strategic insights based on **cost analysis & risk assessment**.  

---  

### **Recommended Approach: AWS Adoption**  
✔ **Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing** to handle peak traffic efficiently.  
✔ **AWS RDS for database management** to improve inventory tracking.  
✔ **AWS IAM & Shield** for security and compliance.  
✔ **AWS QuickSight for real-time business insights.**  
✔ **SQL-Based Cloud Cost Optimization Analysis for Business Insights.**
