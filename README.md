Cloud Migration Strategy for IKEA | AWS vs. Azure Analysis + SQL Cost Optimization
# 🏢 Cloud Strategy Proposal for IKEA  
🚀 **Tech Consulting Case Study | Cloud Migration Strategy + Cloud Cost Optimization & Data Analysis**  

---  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
IKEA, a global leader in home furnishings, faces **digital transformation challenges** as it expands its e-commerce operations. This project presents a **cloud migration strategy**, comparing **AWS vs. Azure** to improve scalability, security, and cost efficiency. Additionally, we analyze **cloud cost optimization, IT risk management, and SQL-driven insights on infrastructure savings.**  

---  

## 🔍 **Business Challenge**  
✔ **Scalability Issues:** High website traffic during peak sales events causes slowdowns.  
✔ **Data Management Problems:** Fragmented inventory and customer data affect decision-making.  
✔ **Security & Compliance Risks:** Need for **GDPR compliance** and enhanced cybersecurity.  
✔ **High IT Infrastructure Costs:** On-premise servers are expensive and inefficient.  
✔ **Need for Data-Driven Decision Making:** Cloud adoption requires strategic insights based on **cost analysis & risk assessment**.  

---  

### **Recommended Approach: AWS Adoption**  
✔ **Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing** to handle peak traffic efficiently.  
✔ **AWS RDS for database management** to improve inventory tracking.  
✔ **AWS IAM & Shield** for security and compliance.  
✔ **AWS QuickSight for real-time business insights.**  
✔ **SQL-Based Cloud Cost Optimization Analysis for Business Insights.**  

---  

## 📌 **Implementation Roadmap**  

### **Phase 1: Assessment & Planning (Month 1-2)**  
🔹 Audit current IT infrastructure.  
🔹 Define cloud migration goals and risk assessment.  
🔹 Perform SQL-based **cloud cost analysis** comparing AWS Reserved Instances vs. On-Demand pricing.  

### **Phase 2: Cloud Migration Execution (Month 3-6)**  
🔹 Move databases to AWS RDS.  
🔹 Deploy applications using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
🔹 Automate a **Python-based report** on cost savings per region.  

### **Phase 3: Security & Optimization (Month 7-9)**  
🔹 Implement AWS Shield & IAM for cybersecurity.  
🔹 Optimize cloud spending using AWS Savings Plans.  
🔹 Run SQL queries to analyze **monthly cost savings trends**.  

### **Phase 4: AI & Data Analytics (Month 10-12)**  
🔹 Implement **AI-driven demand forecasting** with AWS SageMaker.  
🔹 Use **AWS QuickSight** for real-time insights.  
🔹 Automate financial reporting with **Python-based cloud cost optimization script**.  

---  

## 📊 **Expected Business Impact**  
✔ **30% Reduction in IT Costs** within three years.  
✔ **99.9% Uptime** for IKEA's online platform during high traffic events.  
✔ **Faster Data Processing & Decision-Making** for better inventory management.  
✔ **Enhanced Cybersecurity & GDPR Compliance** with AWS security tools.  
✔ **Data-Driven Insights from SQL Reports on Cost Savings & Risk Reduction**.
